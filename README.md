my aim in this project was to create a movie application that offers latest and past collection of movies and series posters together with there information and ratings. 
To achive these app I use html, css and React js. 
The plan is to display data to the browser in a simple good ui while understanding the fubctionality of API's.
You can use the search buttorn to search for movies and series reviews.
